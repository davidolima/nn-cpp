# Simple Neural Network in C++ 

*This repository was created as a personal project.*

## About
The plan is to create a very basic framework capable of creating and training neural networks.
I decided to create this project to better understand the inner workings of artificial intelligence and to improve my C++.

## Run
To run just build the main file.

``` shell
./build.sh && ./main.o
```
